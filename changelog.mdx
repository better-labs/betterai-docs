# Prediction Builder, Mobile UX Enhancements

(_v0.3 Saturday 9/6/25_)

New features added:
- Added Web Search Integration for AI Predictions: AI models now use real-time web search data for predictions, incorporating latest news and developments to improve accuracy.
- Adopted Owly the BetterOwl as our mascot and landing page logo ü¶â.
- By default each prediction will search the web for latest information before generating its prediction. This is a first small step in a long roadmap of enhancements to the prediction pipeline bringing in higher quality best available information from across the web.

Enhancements:
- Enhanced Prediction Results: Better visualization with progress bars and outcome probabilities.
- Mobile-First Design: Optimized spacing and typography for mobile.


# Prediction Builder, Mobile UX Enhancements
(_v0.2 Friday 8/29/25_)

New features added: "Predict with AI" - click the "Predict with AI" to walk through the Prediction Builder flow. This flow will enable you to choose which top AI models to use when building your prediction for a given market. 

Enhancements: Mobile UX is greatly enhanced.


# You Gotta Start Somewhere
(_v0.1 Friday 8/21/25_)

Hello friends üëã

Welcome to the initial v0.1 release of BetterAI\!


For now we have a very minimal working app that shows read only views of predictions for markets on https://polymarket.com/. Next week we'll add the ability for you to trigger new predictions manually.

The app pulls the top 100 markets by volume from https://polymarket.com/ and uses a variety of AI models to generate predictions (high and low quality) multiple times per day.

The AI accuracy is still "under development". The predictions you see on the app are live predictions from the AI models. However, for now they are using minimal data enrichment from the web. We'll improve on this significantly in coming weeks.

**Note:** Mobile view is functional, but may have more UX issues than Desktop.

Cheers üôè
