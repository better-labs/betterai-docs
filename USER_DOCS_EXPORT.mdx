# Changelog

## Friday 8/21/25: v0.1 Release


Hello friends üëã

Welcome to the initial v0.1 release of BetterAI!

**v0.1 Features**

For now we have a very minimal working app that shows read only views of predictions for markets on https://polymarket.com/. Next week we'll add the ability for you to trigger new predictions manually.

The app pulls the top 100 markets by volume from https://polymarket.com/ and uses a variety of AI models to generate predictions (high and low quality) multiple times per day.

The AI accuracy is still "under development". The predictions you see on the app are live predictions from the AI models. However, for now they are using minimal data enrichment from the web. We'll improve on this significantly in coming weeks.

**Note:** Mobile view is functional, but may have more UX issues than Desktop.

Cheers üôè

## Reading AI Predictions

Our AI predictions include several key components:

### Consensus Prediction
The overall probability assessment based on all AI models and available data.

### Model Breakdown
Individual predictions from different AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) with their reasoning.

### Key Factors
The most important elements influencing the prediction, ranked by relevance.

### Data Sources
Links to the specific news articles, reports, and data that informed the analysis.

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Research Multiple Markets**: Use BetterAI's analysis as one input in your decision-making process. Consider multiple related markets and cross-reference predictions.
</Callout>

- **Check Recency**: Look at when the prediction was generated and if any major news has broken since
- **Understand Confidence**: Pay attention to confidence levels - lower confidence suggests higher uncertainty
- **Read the Reasoning**: Don't just look at the prediction percentage; understand the "why" behind it
- **Consider Market Dynamics**: Remember that prediction markets can be influenced by factors beyond just the likely outcome

## Market Categories

BetterAI covers prediction markets across several categories:

- **Elections**: Political races and voting outcomes
- **Geopolitics**: International relations and conflicts  
- **Economics**: Financial markets and economic indicators
- **Technology**: Tech industry developments and launches

# Using AI Predictions Effectively

BetterAI provides sophisticated AI analysis, but getting the most value requires understanding how to interpret and apply the insights.

## Understanding Prediction Components

### Probability Scores
Our AI models provide probability estimates (e.g., 65% chance of outcome). These represent:

- **Consensus View**: The combined assessment across multiple AI models
- **Data-Driven**: Based on current research and information
- **Time-Sensitive**: Reflects conditions at the time of generation

<Callout type="warn">
Probabilities are estimates, not guarantees. Markets can be unpredictable, and new information can dramatically shift outcomes.
</Callout>

### Confidence Levels
Each prediction includes a confidence indicator:

- **High Confidence**: Strong consensus across models with clear supporting data
- **Medium Confidence**: General agreement but with some uncertainty factors
- **Low Confidence**: Significant uncertainty or conflicting information

### Model Diversity
We use multiple AI models because they each have different strengths:

- **GPT-4**: Excellent at pattern recognition and reasoning
- **Claude**: Strong analytical capabilities and nuanced understanding
- **Gemini**: Good at processing diverse data types and sources

When models agree, it typically indicates a stronger prediction. When they disagree, it suggests higher uncertainty.

## Interpreting Research Data

### Source Quality
Our AI research service identifies and analyzes various sources:

- **Primary Sources**: Official statements, government data, company reports
- **News Outlets**: Major media coverage and breaking news
- **Expert Analysis**: Academic papers, think tank reports, expert opinions
- **Social Sentiment**: Aggregate social media and forum discussions

<Callout type="tip">
Pay attention to the recency and credibility of sources. Recent, authoritative sources typically carry more weight in predictions.
</Callout>

### Key Factors Analysis
Each prediction highlights the most important factors influencing the outcome:

1. **Primary Drivers**: The 2-3 most critical factors
2. **Supporting Elements**: Additional relevant considerations  
3. **Risk Factors**: Potential events that could change the outcome
4. **Historical Context**: Relevant past events and patterns

## Timing Your Analysis

### Market Dynamics
Prediction markets are influenced by:

- **Information Flow**: New news can rapidly shift odds
- **Trader Sentiment**: Collective market psychology
- **Liquidity**: Available trading volume and market depth
- **Time Decay**: Approaching resolution dates affect trading patterns

### Optimal Analysis Timing
Generate predictions when:

- **After Major News**: Following significant developments
- **Before Key Events**: Prior to debates, announcements, or deadlines
- **During Market Movement**: When odds are shifting rapidly
- **For Long-Term Analysis**: When planning positions weeks or months ahead

## Combining Multiple Predictions

### Cross-Market Analysis
Related markets often provide additional insights:

- **Presidential Election + Senate Control**: Correlated political outcomes
- **Economic Indicators + Market Performance**: Connected financial predictions
- **Technology Launches + Company Performance**: Business-related markets

### Temporal Analysis
Compare predictions over time:

- **Trend Analysis**: How probabilities change as events approach
- **News Impact**: How specific events affect prediction accuracy
- **Model Consistency**: Which models perform best for different market types

## Risk Management

<Callout type="warn">
BetterAI is an analysis tool, not financial advice. Always do your own research and never risk more than you can afford to lose.
</Callout>

### Diversification
- Don't rely on a single prediction or market
- Spread analysis across different categories and time frames
- Consider opposing viewpoints and alternative scenarios

### Uncertainty Factors
Always consider:

- **Black Swan Events**: Unpredictable, high-impact occurrences
- **Information Delays**: Markets may not reflect the latest developments
- **Model Limitations**: AI has inherent biases and knowledge cutoffs

## Advanced Tips

### Research Validation
- Cross-reference our analysis with your own research
- Look for additional sources not covered in our data collection
- Consider expert opinions and domain-specific knowledge

### Market Timing
- Understand that prediction markets can be inefficient
- Look for discrepancies between AI analysis and current market odds
- Consider both short-term volatility and long-term fundamentals

### Documentation
- Keep records of your predictions and their outcomes
- Track which types of markets and factors you analyze best
- Learn from both successful and unsuccessful analyses

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-Reliance**: Using AI predictions as the sole basis for decisions
2. **Recency Bias**: Overweighting the most recent information
3. **Confirmation Bias**: Only generating predictions that confirm existing beliefs
4. **Ignoring Uncertainty**: Not accounting for confidence levels and risk factors

## Next Steps

- Practice with low-stakes markets to understand prediction patterns
- Experiment with different market categories to find your strengths
- Track prediction accuracy over time to refine your approach
- Join our community discussions to share insights and learn from others

# What are Prediction Markets?

Prediction markets are financial markets where people can bet on the outcomes of future events. They harness the "wisdom of crowds" to generate probabilistic forecasts about everything from elections to economic indicators.

## History of Prediction Markets

### Academic Origins
The concept of prediction markets emerged in the 1980s, but it wasn't until the University of Iowa launched the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) in 1988 that real-money trading began. IEM was designed as a research tool to test the hypothesis that market prices could outpace traditional polls in forecasting election results. This early foray proved remarkably accurate, paving the way for deeper academic interest.

### From Research to Regulation
In the 2000s, economists like Robin Hanson popularized the idea of "ideas futures," proposing formal market scoring rules to guarantee liquidity. Hanson's Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) became the de facto mechanism for many academic and hobbyist markets. Over the same period, organizations such as PredictIt in the U.S. navigated regulatory no-action letters from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, demonstrating that small-scale prediction markets could operate legally.

### Key Milestones
- **2000s**: Launch of PredictIt, IEM expansion, and the first corporate internal markets (e.g., Microsoft's use of internal predictive markets for project forecasting)
- **2014-2016**: Ethereum's emergence enabled decentralized markets like Augur and Gnosis's Omen, democratizing access via smart contracts
- **2021-2024**: The rise of Base-chain platforms brought 0DTE (zero-days-to-expiry) mechanics and seamless USDC settlement, exemplified by Limitless Exchange

## How They Work

1. **Market Creation**: A question is posed (e.g., "Will it rain tomorrow?")
2. **Trading**: People buy and sell shares representing different outcomes
3. **Price Discovery**: Share prices reflect the crowd's collective belief about probability
4. **Resolution**: When the event occurs, winning shares pay out

## Popular Platforms

- **[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/)**: The largest crypto-based prediction market
- **[Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/)**: CFTC-regulated prediction market for US users

## Why They Matter

Prediction markets often outperform traditional forecasting methods because:

- **Financial Incentives**: Real money encourages careful analysis
- **Aggregated Wisdom**: Many perspectives combined
- **Real-Time Updates**: Prices adjust as new information emerges
- **Track Record**: Historical accuracy can be measured and verified

## The Challenge

While prediction markets are powerful, making good predictions requires:
- Deep research into relevant factors
- Understanding of market dynamics
- Analysis of multiple data sources
- Synthesis of complex information

This is where BetterAI comes in - automating the research and analysis process with AI.
